# Curry and Chips 

***Introduction***

“_Curry and Chips_" is a television series aired on British networks in November 1969. The proposed idea of satirizing racism was poorly received by the network company Independent Television (ITV), who pulled it off air after only six episodes were released. “_Curry and Chips_” portrays a cast of factory workers, majority of whom are White, and the newly immigrated Irish-Pakistani Kevin O’Grady, who is played by the controversial White actor, Spike Mulligan, in brown face while using a mocking south asian accent. This edition serves as a reference to the events in history that led to the creation of this series, like the growing immigrant population in the United Kingdom, changing the demographics of the working class. This edition also explores how satire emerged as a genre in British television, along with an examination of the audience that “_Curry and Chips_” was created for.

By highlighting individual scenes that portray racism, the dynamics of the working class, and satire, we provide topical and clear examples as a reference point for the themes within the edition and from within the original source. This edition is limited to six scenes within the first episode in order to give readers an idea of the source and what it represents in a wider context of the post-colonial atmosphere of Britain in 1969. “_Curry and Chips_” is a unique source because it provides multimodal context to what the approach was to racial issues and social unrest in the decades post-decolonization and the World Wars.

***The Source***

This edition provides the link to a digital version of _Curry and Chips_ available on the Internet Archive containing all six episodes, but due to the fragile state of digital archiving and unforeseeable changes in technology that might make this source inaccessible, transcriptions of select scenes have been included from _Curry and Chips_ Season 1, Episode 1 that are representative of the social and cultural context from which _Curry and Chips_ originated. Below are experts depicting complex racial interactions, the social interactions of the working class, and satire in 1960s Britain.

***About the Source***


In post-colonial Britain, there was a steep rise in immigration which created tension within the working class. In 1947, with the partition of India and Pakistan, many people were displaced because of these new borders, and the economic state of these nations was not fairing well considering that the British colonial empire had drained most of their wealth. During this time, opportunities for work brought South Asian immigrants to the British Isles, causing the Indian population in Britain to significantly increase; specifically, “Indian immigration had increased fourfold by 1961 and sixfold by 1962; Pakistani increases were twelve times by 1961 and twenty-five times by 1962." [^1] 

With the sharp spike of population growth over a short period of time, there became a stark rise in racial tension between often unskilled or semi-skilled immigrant workers and the white British working class. With these heightened racial tensions and an increasing immigrant population, the Commonwealth Immigration Law of 1962 was passed which restricted entry to only those with a work permit or those who were highly skilled [^2]. This legislation furthered the divide between white British workers and South Asian workers. This divide was also agitated by the collapse of the British empire and a loss of global power that had been culturally prevalent up until that point. A majority of British culture had been built around colonialism and with this collapse and immigrants from India and Pakistan coming to work in Britain, there became a greater systemic and cultural segregation of South Asian immigrants and their families from the white British working class. This caused a divide among neighbors and coworkers, which greatly shaped the South Asian experience while living and working in 1960s Britain.

Additionally, in the late 60s, conservative political figure Enoch Powell gave his “Rivers of Blood” speech in which he strongly opposed the rise in immigration that had been happening throughout the decade. His speech further revealed underlying racial tensions of the time and gave a greater cultural understanding of how the wider British population was reacting to immigration. His speech was also in reaction to the Commonwealth Immigrants Act of 1968, which further restricted immigration in Britain.[^3]

Simultaneously, satire as a way of subjugating race with humor was becoming increasingly popular in British entertainment during the 1960s. Satire often poses to question culturally relevant and controversial subjects by criticizing them through exaggeration and humor, and in 1960s Britain subjects of race, immigration, and working class politics were in high contention. Satire as a way of dealing with this tension partly came about because of the integration of the television into working people’s homes. Film and television serials were no longer something that someone needed to make plans to go see because it was right there, in the home. This rise of satire in television comes in contrast with radio, which was the popular form of entertainment prior to the 1960s, because the effects of satire were better perceived with things like slap-stick comedy which required a visual element.[^4] 

With satire rising in popularity, it brought its own contentions from critics. During the 1960s in Britain, comedy was often used to “openly [parade]...prejudices and petty-minded attitudes of the different social classes in British society,” and these prejudices extended to race. Many were concerned that, while satire was meant to bring recognition to the racial tension in Britain at the time, that they were actually perceived as doing the opposite and were instead further re-enforcing negative stereotypes about South Asian immigrants and other marginalized groups. This was also specifically concerning because satire and comedy was seen as being used to “[maintain] and [shape] ethnocentric attitudes” of the time, further dividing the South Asian working class from the white working class in Britain.[^5]

Despite these concerns there were many television shows being produced at the time with race as a central part of the story. Some such shows included _Till Death Us Do Part_ (1965) & _Curry and Chips_ (1969), both of which were directed by Johnny Speight and were satirical comedies concerned with how race and class intersected in 1960s Britain. Many of these shows faced backlash from their use of offensive racialized language and slurs, as well as the exaggerated stereotypes that were used for comedic effect. One major contention between these shows and their audience was whether what was being depicted was effective satire, or rather a way to push “anti-liberal messages… presented as laughable satire.”[^6]

In _Curry and Chips_, Spike Milligan in brown face, plays Kevin O’Grady who is an Irish-Pakistani immigrant worker. O’Grady is often used as the punchline for the joke because he is portrayed as out of place among the white workers in the factory. There is also blatant racism within the show in the use of various slurs and derogatory terms, all within the first episode.[^7] This representation reinforces the white working classes views in Britain at the time by not actively subverting these racial stereotypes and at times playing them up for comedic effect. The audiences and television networks tended to agree that this way of portraying racial tension was unproductive and offensive to South Asian people, which ultimately led to the show’s run from from November to December 1969 to be cut short because of its support of negative views of different racial and ethnic groups that reinforced harmful widespread cultural beliefs at the time.

***About the Edition***


The original version of the television show Curry and Chips is not accessible through its original source, London Weekend Television on the ITV Network. However, it is readily available on YouTube and streaming services like Plex, where the six-episode season is posted for public viewing. Although the episodes remain under copyright by London Weekend Television, they are still accessible for public display.

The full six-episode series can be found on physical DVD copies, which are still being exchanged through secondary markets like eBay. Additionally, the Internet Archive offers the whole season on its website, serving as a non-profit source for information and entertainment for historians and researchers. [^1]

The procedures used for presenting this source involved taking various points from the first episode of the show and capturing still images of specific scenes. The use of still images allows for more context of the scene itself. To alter the images slightly, applications like Adobe Photoshop helped present the highest quality picture for the edition.

We chose to use still images rather than full clips of scenes because they are at a lower risk for copyright claims from the ITV Network, regardless of our motive for the edit. Additionally, a still frame highlights the specific moment of the clip that we want to emphasise to the readers. By showing a full clip to a reader who has not seen the show, it may be difficult to pick up on the plot summary and character exposition. In turn, we opted to use still images to slow down the comprehension of the scene, offering background and context through the transcripts.

The transcripts offered include necessary context for the scene, exact transcription of dialogue, and descriptions of character movements that may be important for the reader’s perception.

Altercations that we made were focused on the clarity and contrast of the still images, as the original video is slightly blurred. To enhance the picture, we used Adobe Photoshop to demonstrate any changes in the original source.
